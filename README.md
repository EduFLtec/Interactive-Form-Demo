# Interactive-Form-Demo
An interactive form with simulated authentication, Part of the Zenva Create Interactive Pages with Javascript and the DOM API Course. I tried to make enough changes to the form to make it work for my purposes. It is mock sign up page for an English eLearning website that I may develop in the future.
